# Near Contract Interface Macros

This is a WIP fork of [near-sdk-macros](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/tree/master/near-sdk-macros) that enables generics for [Near contracts](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/overview).

Defines what information is gathered and what code is generated when using the `#[contract]` attribute.
